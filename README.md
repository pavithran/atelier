# Atelier

Atelier lets several coding agents work on one project at the same time
without trampling each other or the person who owns the project. It runs on
Cloudflare Workers, Durable Objects and Artifacts, and is driven by a
dependency-free command, `atelier`, that any agent able to run a shell
command can use.

It rests on three rules.

1. **Every item of work has exactly one owner.** Ownership moves by a
   recorded handoff. The owner holds the only write token for the item's
   workspace, and a handoff revokes it.
2. **Evidence is graded.** A check that Atelier ran itself, in a clean clone
   of exactly the head it reads from Artifacts, is *Observed*. Anything an
   agent says it did is *Reported*. A required check with no observed result
   at the current head is *Pending*. Only Observed passes count.
3. **The project owner decides.** The project owner is the person the
   project belongs to; in the API they act as a reserved actor, `owner`
   unless the deployment names another (see Setup).
   Work reaches the project only when the project owner accepts it and
   merges it. Changes to protected paths also need approval from a model
   other than the item owner's, or from the project owner.

The web inbox answers one question, *what needs the project owner now?*, and ranks the
things a person must decide above the things an agent must fix.

## How it works

In outline: a project's main branch is copied into an Artifacts repository,
the *baseline*. Each item is a fork of the baseline, its *workspace*. Agents
work in their workspace, push to it, and run checks against it. The project owner merges
accepted work into the real checkout, and the baseline follows.

In detail:

| Step | Who | What happens |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `atelier init` | the project owner, in the project checkout | Creates the baseline repository and pushes the current branch to it. Records the required checks and the protected paths. |
| `atelier new "title" --scope 'src/**'` | anyone | Creates an item. The scope is what the item intends to touch; overlapping live scopes are flagged in the inbox. |
| `atelier claim t3 --as claude-code/opus-5.5` | an agent | The project's Durable Object grants ownership atomically, so a second claimant is refused. The Worker forks the baseline and mints an eight-hour write token for the owner alone. The CLI clones the workspace into `~/Library/Caches/ai-projects/cloudflare-git/work/`. |
| `atelier push` | the item's owner | Pushes, then asks the Worker to read the workspace head from Artifacts. The ledger records the head Atelier saw, not the one the agent named. |
| `atelier check` | anyone | Clones the workspace afresh at that head (or runs in a Cloudflare container with `--sandbox` or `sandboxOnly` policy), runs each required check, measures which paths changed since the baseline, and records the results as Observed. A result for a head that has since moved is refused. |
| `atelier report "…"` | anyone | Records a Reported claim. It is shown and never counted. |
| `atelier submit` | the item's owner | Marks the item ready. The gate states what still blocks it. |
| `atelier handoff t3 --to codex/gpt-5.5` | the item's owner or the project owner | Moves ownership and revokes the old write token. The workspace and its history carry over; the work is not forked again. |
| `atelier review t3 --approve` | a different agent, or the project owner | Required when the item changes a protected path. A reviewer of the same model as the owner does not count. |
| `atelier accept t3` | the project owner, or the Accept button | Allowed only when the gate is clear. Pins the accepted head. |
| `atelier merge t3` | the project owner, in the project checkout | Fetches exactly the accepted head, merges it with `--no-ff`, attaches the item's provenance as a git note on `refs/notes/atelier`, and pushes the new main to the baseline. Pushing the code to GitHub stays a separate, deliberate step; after `atelier notes-remote github`, each merge pushes the provenance notes, and only them, to that remote. |

The gate for acceptance is a pure function in [`src/rules.ts`](src/rules.ts):
every required check observed passing at the current head; the changed paths
observed; no rejection at that head; and, if a protected path changed, an
approval at that head from a different model or from the project owner. What a check
executes is protected automatically: a script it runs (`./check.sh`,
`node scripts/verify.mjs`), and `package.json` when it goes through a package
manager, whose scripts an item could otherwise rewrite. An item therefore
cannot quietly weaken the check that grades it. Files a check only reads, such
as the code under test, are not protected, and nor is test configuration such
as `vitest.config.ts` unless the project protects it.

## Projects governed by ControlPlane

Atelier and ControlPlane each own different facts. ControlPlane owns policy:
who may act and what is protected. Atelier owns live state: who holds which
item now, the evidence at its head and its handoff chain. Git owns what
merged.

- `atelier init` reads `docs/control-plane/agent-policy.v1.json`,
  `execution-policy.v1.json` and `project-adapter.v1.json` when they exist.
  Eligible agents are the available ones; overlapping claims are refused when
  the policy says `overlapping_claims: refuse`; protected paths are the
  adapter's protected surfaces, the maintenance paths, and the agent and
  ControlPlane files themselves. Atelier never writes these files.
- Copying a project into Artifacts is an off-machine copy, so `init` refuses
  a ControlPlane project until the project owner's approval is recorded with
  `--approval "…"`. The approval is kept in the project's policy and quoted in
  every merge receipt.
- `atelier merge` writes a `control-plane.landing-receipt` into
  `docs/control-plane/landing-receipts/` as part of the merge commit, so the
  merge and its record are one change.
- `atelier owners` prints one line per live item for a wrap to copy into the
  project's state record; `atelier owners --json` and
  `GET /api/projects/NAME/owners` give the same view without titles, scopes
  or paths. Publishing it to Observatory is ControlPlane's to do, because
  Observatory reads only what ControlPlane publishes.

## What is enforced and what is trusted

Enforced by construction:

- one owner per item, because the project's Durable Object handles one
  request at a time;
- one live write token per workspace, minted for the owner and revoked on
  handoff, release or abandonment;
- observed evidence tied to the head Atelier reads from Artifacts, not the
  head an agent reports;
- acceptance only through the gate, and merging only of the accepted head.

Trusted, and stated here so nobody assumes otherwise:

- **Identity is declared.** Every caller shares one API token, and the actor
  name (`harness/model`) is what the caller says it is. The token proves only
  that the caller is one of the project owner's own tools. The write token is what stops
  a non-owner from pushing.
- **Check execution is explicit.** Local checks run in a clean clone at
  the verified head, but a caller with the shared token can forge local
  evidence. Cloudflare container checks execute on the server and are
  available with `--sandbox`; `sandboxOnly` policy requires that evidence.
  The container integration still needs deployment and a live runtime check.
- **Merging happens locally.** The Artifacts binding has no merge operation,
  and the iCloud checkout is the source of truth, so `atelier merge` merges
  with the local git.

## Setup

Requirements: Node 24 or later, git, a Cloudflare account on the Workers Paid
plan (Artifacts is in open beta there), and `wrangler` logged in.

```bash
npm install && npm run types && npm test
```

Write the server token into the Keychain once, by hand:

```bash
security add-generic-password -s atelier.API_TOKEN -a "$USER" -w
```

Deploy, then make the Worker's secret match the Keychain:

```bash
npx wrangler deploy
```

```bash
security find-generic-password -s atelier.API_TOKEN -w | tr -d '\n' | npx wrangler secret put ATELIER_TOKEN
```

The project owner acts as the actor `owner`, and the inbox asks "What needs
you now?". To use your own actor and name, set `OWNER_ACTOR` and
`OWNER_NAME`, either as `vars` in `wrangler.jsonc` or as secrets, which keeps
them out of the configuration:

```bash
printf jo | npx wrangler secret put OWNER_ACTOR
```

```bash
printf Jo | npx wrangler secret put OWNER_NAME
```

`atelier login` asks the server for the owner's actor, so the CLI follows
whatever the Worker is set to.

Point the CLI at the Worker and register a project:

```bash
npm link
```

```bash
atelier login --server https://atelier.example.workers.dev
```

```bash
atelier init --check "npm test" --protect AGENTS.md --protect "wrangler.*"
```

Run `init` inside the project checkout. `atelier guide` prints the
instructions an agent needs; paste them into the project's `AGENTS.md` or
`CLAUDE.md`.

## Local cache cleanup

`atelier gc --project NAME` previews local directories eligible for removal.
Add `--apply` to remove them. `--dry-run` explicitly requests the preview.
The command uses the configured cache (`ATELIER_CACHE` when set) and never
deletes Artifacts repositories or changes the project's checkout.

A workspace is eligible only when the server confirms that its item merged,
its HEAD equals the accepted head, and it has no changed, untracked or ignored
files, extra commits in refs or reflogs, linked worktrees, initialized
submodules, or a Git operation in progress. Cleanup checks
its recorded project and item identity and refreshes the item's state before
removal. The current directory and its ancestors are preserved. Symlinked
directories are not followed. Stop editing a candidate before applying cleanup.

Check and diff clones carry a local record of their project, creation time,
and process. A recorded clone is eligible after 24 hours only when its process
and any recorded check child have exited. Runs for other projects, records
that cannot be verified, and older clones without records are preserved.
Normal completion removes both the clone and its record.

## Local development

`npm run dev` serves the Worker on localhost. The Artifacts binding always
reaches the real account, even locally, so local runs create real
repositories. Pass a throwaway token with
`npx wrangler dev --var ATELIER_TOKEN:localtest`; do not write `.dev.vars`
into an iCloud project.

`npm test` runs two pools. The pure functions in `src/rules.ts` and
`src/diff.ts` are tested by `node --test` (`test/*.test.ts`). The
`test/*.spec.ts` files run inside the Workers runtime through the Workers
test pool, against the Ledger Durable Object with its real SQLite storage
and no network access; `tsc -p test` typechecks them against the types
`wrangler types` generates. Workerd logs each refusal those tests assert as
an uncaught promise rejection (`uncaught exception … 409|owned|…`); those
lines are the refusals under test, not failures.

## Cost

Artifacts bills operations and storage from 14 October 2026: the first
10,000 operations and 1 GB each month are included in Workers Paid, then
$0.15 per thousand operations and $0.50 per GB-month. One item uses a fork,
a few token mints and a handful of pushes, fetches and clones, so ordinary
use should stay inside the included allowance. That is an estimate from the
operations the CLI performs, not a measurement.

## Licence

MIT. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## Decisions, projects, and history

The Decisions page puts reviews and blockers across projects beside the
selected task. Passing output stays collapsed; failed checks show their
output. Projects contains active work and task creation. History retains
merged and closed tasks with their evidence. Ownership and Git details
remain available inside each task.

Approval and acceptance forms carry the revision displayed on the page.
The server checks both the ledger and Artifacts before accepting that
revision. A stale page must be refreshed. Each reviewer's latest verdict
at a revision replaces their earlier verdict; another reviewer's rejection
still blocks acceptance.

## Finish and land

After committing, an agent runs `atelier finish` in its claimed workspace.
It pushes, runs required checks, and submits only if those checks pass and
the workspace remains unchanged. A project with `sandboxOnly` enabled uses
the cloud runner automatically. `--sandbox` selects it explicitly.

The project owner can complete an exact revision with:

```sh
atelier land t9 --head FULL_COMMIT_SHA --approve --note 'Reviewed changes'
```

`--approve` records an explicit owner review. Without it, any required review
must already exist. Acceptance still goes through the gate. Already accepted
work needs only `atelier land t9 --head FULL_COMMIT_SHA`.

Landing records a journal in the registered checkout's Git directory,
`atelier-landing.json`. If publishing the baseline or recording the merge
fails, rerun the same command. It resumes from the local merge commit. It
refuses a different revision, a dirty checkout, or concurrent landing. If a
process stops during the uncommitted Git merge, inspect `git status` and
resolve or abort that merge before retrying. The journal preserves the
original revision and starting commit. Never remove it to bypass a mismatch.

The browser provides this local command after acceptance. It does not run a
network-accessible local executor. Deployment and pushing the project branch
to its own remotes remain separate decisions.

## Push event setup

The Worker has a Queues consumer for `cf.artifacts.repo.pushed` notices in
the `atelier` namespace. It rereads the default branch from Artifacts,
ignores unrelated branches and duplicate events, and retries failed reads.
A new push invalidates acceptance and evidence for the previous revision.
The CLI's push observation remains available when event delivery is delayed.

Before enabling this in production, provision a queue and dead-letter queue,
subscribe the intended Artifacts repositories' push events to it, and add a
consumer to the release configuration:

```json
{"queues":{"consumers":[{"queue":"atelier-events","max_batch_size":10,"max_retries":5,"dead_letter_queue":"atelier-events-dead-letter"}]}}
```

Queue provisioning, subscription creation, and deployment are release actions;
adding the consumer handler alone does not activate event delivery. See
[Artifacts event subscriptions](https://developers.cloudflare.com/artifacts/guides/event-subscriptions/).

## Local visual review

Run `node test/preview.mjs` for a local, read-only preview with illustrative
content. It prints its URL. The preview cannot approve, merge, or create live
tasks. Use `?state=empty`, `/p/cloudflare-git/t1?state=failed`, `state=ready`,
`state=accepted`, `state=merged`, `state=unavailable`, or `state=long` to inspect
important states. Append `theme=dark` to inspect the dark palette.

The visual composition is saved in `.impeccable/mocks/decisions.png` with its
prompt. Product intent lives in `PRODUCT.md`; the implemented visual system
is recorded in `DESIGN.md`.

## Integration basis

The decision workspace integrates t1 at `5ebb64e9` (cloud checks), t4 at
`8c44da71` (real Ledger runtime tests), and the merged t5 cleanup work.
Their commits remain in the integration history. Combined test discovery
runs TypeScript and JavaScript unit tests and the Workers runtime suite.
Cloud checks now bound retained output and mark interrupted runs failed
instead of leaving them indefinitely running. Local verification does not
establish a successful production container run.
